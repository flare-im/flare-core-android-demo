/**
 * The strings the kit renders itself — accessibility labels, delivery states, composer tools,
 * action sheets. Their defaults are Chinese and a host with another UI language has to supply
 * them (see the kit's FlareStrings.kt); without this an English UI announced 返回 / 发送 / 已读.
 *
 * The language follows the app's own resources (`flare_kit_language`), so the kit and the app
 * can never disagree: `values-zh-rCN` keeps the kit defaults, every other locale gets English.
 * The table covers every kit string reachable from the screens this app composes.
